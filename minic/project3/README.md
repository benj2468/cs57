# Project 3

## Description

This project was to take in compiled, and partially optimized IR, and output assembly that can run the program!



## Pipeline

```
C File --(clang-10)>> IR --(Project 2)>> Optimized IR --(Project 3)>> Assembly --(as)>> Machine Code
```

## Testing

Place a c file you wish to test in the `./tests` directory. Then, simply run `./test.sh` and it will load the c files into the pipeline.
