# Project 1: Front End

# Description

I have implemented MiniC parser and lexer using antlr4 and python3.

# Extra Credit

I've implemented the following features in addition to the requirements:

1. Type checking on:
   1. Function Calls (arg #, and arg type)
   2. Operation
   3. Assignments
2. Support of strings, and potential for other primitives
3. Functions can have multiple parameters
4. Multiple functions

# Helpful tools

I also added some developer flags to help with development

1. `-c <outfile>` performs code-generation and generates the IR representation of your miniC code!
2. `-v` verbose will print errors with tracebacks, otherwise will print fancy errors
3. `--no-emit` will not print the AST
